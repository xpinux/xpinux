I am a verified Cisco CCNA and CCNA Security professional, Microsoft SC-100, SC-200 and (ISC)Â² CC holder, and proficient in C, C++, Python, and PHP. As a former cryptographer during my mandatory military service in Greece, I am currently a L1 SOC Analyst at Space Hellas S.A., where I am responsible for monitoring and responding to threats, VAs, pen tests etc. My technical abilities, focus on cybersecurity, and passion for learning make me an excellent fit for any organization.
