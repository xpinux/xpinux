- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xpinux!
Little bit about myself. I am a very enthusiastic person
Who loves technology, especially cybersecutity, networking and emulation.

I am currently working a a L1 SOC analyst.

Programming is something that I fall in love in my early beginings with computers.
That's why I am keeping programming as a hobbyist.
